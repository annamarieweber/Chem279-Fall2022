Eq.(3.3). (In unit of eV !!!)
Overlap: AO overlap matrix.
p: number of alpha electrons.
q: number of beta  electrons.
H_core: the part of fock matrices that does not depend on the density
matrices, i.e., Eq.(1.4) and Eq.(1.5) excluding the part with P. (In unit of eV !!!)
Ga & Gb: the part of fock matrices that depends on the density matrices. (In unit of eV !!!)
