The energy and gradient matrices are all in the unit of eV.

OV_RA : gradient of overlap matrix, rows are x y z, columns are
overlap matrix element (S11, S12, S13 ... S21, S22 ...), so the element
corresponds to row x and column S_ij means the gradient of S_ij over
R_Ax, where A is the atom that the ith AO's center is located on.

gamma_RA : gradient of gamma matrix, rows are x y z, columns are atom
pairs (A, B), so a matrix element corresponds to row y and atom pair
(A, B) means the gradient of gamma_AB over R_Ay; an element that
corresponds to row z and atom pair (B, C) means the gradient of 
gamma_BC over R_Bz.

gradient : gradient of energy, rows are x y z, columns are atoms. So
the second row and Ath column means energy gradient over R_Ay.
