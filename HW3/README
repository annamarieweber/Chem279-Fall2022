1. The input files are the *.txt files, the first line contains number of
atoms and molecular charge, following lines are "E X Y Z" format, where E
is atomic symbol and XYZ are the coordinates.

2. The reference results are the *.out files. For H2, every intermediate
matrix and the final energy has been printed out for you to debug. For 
C2H2, only the AO overlap matrix and final energy has been printed out.

3. The exponents and contraction coefficients provided at the bottom of
page 2 may be a bit confusing. For the first matrix of H atom, the first
column is the exponents and the second column is the contraction coefficients.
In other words, the 1s orbital of H is the summation of 3 Gaussian functions
with exponents in column 1 and linear combination coefficients in column 2
respectively. For the second matrix of C atom, the first column is the exponents
which is identical for both 2s and 2p orbitals. The second column is the
contraction coefficients of the 2s orbital, and the third column is the
contraction coefficients of the 2p orbitals (same for the 2px, 2py, 2pz orbitals).
